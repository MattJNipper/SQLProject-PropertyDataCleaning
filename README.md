# SQLProject-PropertyDataCleaning

This repo is a showcase of some of my SQL knowledge for my portfolio as a data analyst. The queries focus on filling in NULL values with known data from other places in the dataset and parsing large chunks of data into individual and more useful pieces of information. Please feel free to look through the code to get an idea of my experience with SQL.

The data that accompanies this SQL code is in the excel files included in the repo.
